        <h3>Arrow Functions</h3>
        <p>ES6 introduced a new syntax for declaring functions called thearrowsyntax.
          These make declaring functions much more succinct by using less verbose syntax.
          Arrow functions can be identified by the 'arrow' symbol, => that gives them their
          name. The parameters come before the arrow and the main body of the function
          comes after. Arrow functions are always anonymous, so if you want to refer to
          them, you must assign them to a variable. For example, the square function
          we wrote earlier can be written like so:</p>
          <code>const square = x => x*x;</code>
          <p>Arrow functions have a number of advantages over other ways of declaring functions:

They are much less verbose than normal function declarations.
Single parameters don't need putting into parentheses.
The body of the function doesn't need placing inside a block if it's
 only one line.
The return keyword isn't required if the return statement is the only
 statement in the body of the function.
They don't bind their own value of this to the function
 (we'll see why this is a particularly useful property when we cover
 objects later in the book).
In the square example above parameter, x didn't need to go in
parentheses because it's the only parameter. Multiple parameters
need to go inside parentheses, for example, the following function
adds two numbers together:</p>
<code>const add = (x,y) => x + y;</code>
<p>Arrow functions make perfect candidates for short, anonymous functions,
  and you will often see them used later in the book.</p>

        <h3>Map()</h3>
        <p>he map() method is very similar to the forEach() method.
          It also iterates over an array, and takes a callback function
          as a parameter that is invoked on each item in the array.
          This is often used to process data returned from databases
          in array form, such as adding HTML tags to plain text.
          The difference is that it returns a new array that replaces
          each value with the return value of the callback function.
          For example, we can square every number in an array using
          the square function we wrote previously as a callback to
          the map() method:</p>
          <code>[1,2,3].map( x => 2 * x);
<< [2,4,6]</code>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Reduce()</h3>
        <p>The reduce() method is another method that iterates over each
        value in the array, but this time it cumulatively combines each
        result to return just a single value. The callback function is
        used to describe how to combine each value of the array with
        the running total. This is often used to calculate statistics
        such as averages from data stored in an array. It usually
        takes two parameters. The first parameter represents the accumulated
        value of all the calculations so far, and the second parameter
        represents the current value in the array. The following example
        shows how to sum an array of numbers:</p>
        <code>[1,2,3,4,5].reduce( (acc,val) => prev + val );
<< 15</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>filter()</h3>
        <p>The filter() method returns a new array that only contains items
          from the original array that return true when passed to the callback.
          For example, we can filter an array of numbers to just the even numbers
          using the following code:</p>
          <code>const numbers = [ 2, 7, 6, 5, 11, 23, 12 ]
numbers.filter(x => x%2 === 0 ); // this returns true if the number is even
<< [ 2, 6, 12 ]</code>
      </li>
