    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The parse() method takes a string of data in JSON format and
          returns a JavaScript object:</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The stringify() method does the opposite, taking a JavaScript
          object and returning a string of JSON data, as can be seen in the
          example:</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There are no 'swipe' events. These need to be created by
          using a combination of touchstart , touchmove , and touchleave events
          that monitor the distance and direction moved from start to finish of a
          touch event.

          There were proposals for gesture eventsthat may be supported in the
          future, but it seems they are not scheduled to be part of the
          specification anytime soon.

          If you need to implement gestures, it's probably a good idea to use a
          library such asHammer.JSorzingtouchthat makes events such as swipe,
          pinch and rotate easy to implement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Be careful when using the touchstart event as it fires as soon as
          a user touches the screen. They may be touching the screen because they
          want to zoom in or swipe, and a touchstart event listener could prevent
          them from doing this.

          The click event is often a much safer option as it still fires when the
          screen is touched, but there’s a slight delay of 300ms, allowing the
          user time to perform another action with the device. The click event
          can be thought of as a "tap" in the context of a touch event.</p>

        <h3>ES6 Class Declarations</h3>
        <p>Before ES6, constructor functions were the only way of achieving class-like behavior in JavaScript.</p>
        <br>
        <p>ES6 introduced the newclass declarationsyntax that does exactly the same thing as a constructor function,
          but looks much similar to writing a class in a class-based programming language. Here is the dice example
          again, using a class declaration:</p>
        <code>
            class Dice {
              constructor(sides=6) {
                  this.sides = sides;
              }
              roll() {
                  return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
              }
          }
          </code>

      </li>
      <h3>Modular JavaScript</h3>
      <p>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in
        other files and by other modules. This helps to keep code organized in separate, reusable files, which
        improves code maintainability. The code in a module should have a single purpose, and group together
        functions with distinct functionality. For example, you might keep any functions used for Ajax in their
        own module. This could then be used in any projects where Ajax was required. </p>
      <li>
        <h3>Constructor Functions</h3>
        <p>By convention, the names of constructor functions or class declarations are capitalized, which is the
          convention used for classes in class-based programming languages.</p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Static Methods</h3>
        <p>The static keyword can be used in class declarations to create a static method. These are sometimes called
          class methods in other programming languages. A static method is called by the class directly rather than
          by instances of the class.</p>
        <code>
            class Dice {
              constructor(sides=6) {
                  this.sides = sides;
              }
              roll() {
                  return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
              }
              static description() {
                  return 'A way of choosing random numbers'
              }
          }
          </code>
