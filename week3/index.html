    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><p>The parse() method takes a string of data in JSON format and
        returns a JavaScript object:</p></li>
      <li><p>The stringify() method does the opposite, taking a JavaScript
        object and returning a string of JSON data, as can be seen in the
        example:</p></li>
      <li><p>There are no 'swipe' events. These need to be created by
        using a combination of touchstart , touchmove , and touchleave events
        that monitor the distance and direction moved from start to finish of a
        touch event.

        There were proposals for gesture eventsthat may be supported in the
        future, but it seems they are not scheduled to be part of the
        specification anytime soon.

        If you need to implement gestures, it's probably a good idea to use a
        library such asHammer.JSorzingtouchthat makes events such as swipe,
        pinch and rotate easy to implement.</p></li>
      <li><p>Be careful when using the touchstart event as it fires as soon as
        a user touches the screen. They may be touching the screen because they
        want to zoom in or swipe, and a touchstart event listener could prevent
        them from doing this.

        The click event is often a much safer option as it still fires when the
        screen is touched, but thereâ€™s a slight delay of 300ms, allowing the
        user time to perform another action with the device. The click event
        can be thought of as a "tap" in the context of a touch event.</p>

        <h3>ES6 Class Declarations</h3>
        <p>Before ES6, constructor functions were the only way of achieving class-like behavior in JavaScript.</p>
          <br><br>
          <p>ES6 introduced the newclass declarationsyntax that does exactly the same thing as a constructor function, 
          but looks much similar to writing a class in a class-based programming language. Here is the dice example 
          again, using a class declaration:</p>
          <code>
            class Dice {
              constructor(sides=6) {
                  this.sides = sides;
              }
              roll() {
                  return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random() + 1)
              }
          }
          </code>
      </li>
    </ul>
