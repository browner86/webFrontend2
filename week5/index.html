    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
        <p>The recommended way to determine browser support for a feature is to
          use feature detection. This is done using an if statement to check
          whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call the
          method. For example, say we want to use the shiny new holoDeck API
          (as far as I know, this doesn't actually exist ... yet), we would wrap
          any method calls inside the following if block:</p>
          <code>if (window.holoDeck) {
            virtualReality.activate();
            }
          </code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Alert</h3>
        <p>The most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show
          a dialog at certain points in the code. Because alert() stops a program
          from running until OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put
          breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of variables at
          that point to see if they’re what we expect them to be. Take the
          following example that checks to see if a person’s age is appropriate:</p>
        </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Console</h3>
        <p>We've already seen and used the console.log() method. This can be
        used to log the value of variables at different stages of the program,
        although it will not actually stop the execution of the program in the
        same way as alert() does. For example, we could add some console.log()
        statements in the amIOldEnough() function, to log the position in the
        function as well as the value of the age variable:</p></li>

      <li>
        <h3>debugger</h3>
        <p>One of the most useful commands is the debugger keyword. This will
          create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the
          code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to. You
          can also hover over any variables to see what value they hold at that
          point. The program can then be restarted by clicking on the 'play'
          button.</p>
          <code>
            function amIOldEnough(age){
                  debugger;
                      if (age < 12) {
                      debugger;
                      return 'No, sorry.';
                      } else if (age < 18) {
                      debugger;
                      return 'Only if you are accompanied by an adult.';
                      } else {
                      debugger;
                      return 'Yep, come on in!';
                  }
              }
              amIOldEnough(16);
          </code>
          <p>Remember to remove any references to the debugger command before
            shipping any code, otherwise the program will appear to freeze when
            people try to use it!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Throw</h3>
        <p>So far we’ve seen errors that are thrown automatically by the JavaScript
        engine when an error occurs. It’s also possible to throw your own
        exceptions using the throw statement. This will allow for any problems
        in your code to be highlighted and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly
        in the background.

        The throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing
        the execution of the program to stop. For example, all the following
        lines of code will cause a program to halt:</p>
        <code>throw new Error('Something has gone badly wrong!');</code>
