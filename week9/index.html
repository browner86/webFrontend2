    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Window Object</h3>
        <h4>Browser Object Model</h4>
        <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain
          information about the browser and computer screen. For example, we can find out which browser is being
          used to view a page (though, this method is unreliable). We can also find out the dimensions of the
          screen it is viewed on, and which pages have been visited before the current page. It can also be
          used for the rather dubious practice of creating pop-up windows, if you’re into annoying your users.</p>
        <h4>Dialogs</h4>
        <p>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog
          box. The message is provided as an argument to the method, and undefined is always returned:</p>
        <p>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation
          dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel.
          It returns the boolean values of true if the user clicks OK, and false if the user clicks Cancel:</p>
        <p>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows
          a message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text.
          This text is then returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null
          is returned:</p>

        <code>window.alert('Hello');</code>
        <code>window.confirm('Do you wish to continue?');</code>
        <code>window.prompt('Please enter your name:');</code>
        <h4>location</h4>
        <p>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. It
          contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments of the URL.
          The href property returns the full URL as a string:</p>
        <code>window.location.href 
                << "https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja"</code>

        <p>The window.location object also has the following methods:
          The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. If it’s given a parameter of true, 
          it will force the browser to reload the page from the server, instead of using a cached page.
          The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter, for example:</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>html5 APIs</h3>
        <h4>Websockets</h4>
        <p>Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – also known as push messaging. 
          This means that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.</p>
        <h4>Notifications</h4>
        <p>The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications. This is usually a popup 
          in the corner of the screen, but it changes depending on the operating system. An advantage of using the 
          system notification is that they will still be displayed even if the web page that calls them isn't the 
          current tab.</p>
          <code>if(window.Notification) {
            Notification.requestPermission();
        }</code>
        <code>
          if(window.Notification) {
            Notification.requestPermission()
            .then((permission) => {
                if(Notification.permission === 'granted') {
                new Notification('Hello JavaScript!');
                }
            });
        }
        notification.close();
        </code>
        <code>
          const notification = new Notification('JavaScript: Novice to Ninja',{
            body: 'The new book from SitePoint',
            icon: 'sitepointlogo.png'
        });
        </code>
        <h4>Multimedia</h4>
        <p>A video clip can be inserted with the <video> tag, using the src attribute to point to the movie file:</p>
          <code><video src='http://movie.mp4' controls>
            Your browser does not support the video element.
        </video></code>
